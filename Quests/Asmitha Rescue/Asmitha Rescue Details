Dialogue Notes:
    Balito: I already told you what I know. Dvai went north-west to The Den, that's where she wants to sell Asmitha.
    Balito: Dvai the Maggot-Eater bought her from Deidre and took her to The Den. He wants to sell her there. He thinks he will get a lot more money on that fine cook from those other savages.
